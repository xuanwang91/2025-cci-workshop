# 2025 CCI Workshop: AI for Science with Foundation Models

Time: **12:30 PM - 3:PM ET, Thursday, May 1st, 2025**

Location: **Data and Decision Sciences Building, Room TBD, Virginia Tech**

Zoom Link: **[https://virginiatech.zoom.us/j/8682759193](https://virginiatech.zoom.us/j/8682759193)**


## Workshop at a Glance
The capabilities of foundation models for science big data span a wide spectrum, from the atomic level, where it solves partial differential equations for quantum systems, to the molecular level, predicting chemical or protein structures, and further extending to societal predictions like infectious disease outbreaks. However, there remain significant challenges to unlock the full potential of foundation models for scientific discovery, such as ensuring trustworthiness, achieving personalization, and adapting to multi-modal data representation. This workshop aims to inspire and empower CCI researchers interested in real-world science and healthcare applications, AI, and machine learning to explore new ideas and discuss recent research challenges in related areas. 


## Registration
We highly recommend that people attend our workshop in person, as this will facilitate research discussion with all speakers and other participants. Registration is free but required for everyone who plans to attend the workshop, either in person or on Zoom. The registration information will be leveraged for us to book a room and gather statistics for further enhancements.

The registration deadline is **Sunday, April 27, 2025**. Here is the registration link: [**Registration**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfglmDaF_TCaKWbVivQV4LXLORHOkpKnEn_JaIWet_DmtXySQ/viewform?usp=dialog).
